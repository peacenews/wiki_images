# wiki_images
This repository contains image sub-directories for each repository that any images relate to (such as /ecosystem/ ). Github does not prove a straight-forward way to add images to a repository's Wiki. This provides a consistent place to store Peace News images and it keeps them out of the main repository's file-base.
